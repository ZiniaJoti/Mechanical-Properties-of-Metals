# A Comparison Study of Metals Mechanical Properties Under Tensile Loading Using Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Here, we demostrated Lammps code with an example of tensile test of metal used in the paper Al, Fe, Cu, Ni and 
the snapshots of the simulations at the beginning and at the end of the simulations.

The code [metal.lammps](https://github.com/ZiniaJoti/Mechanical-Properties-of-Metals/blob/main/metal.lammps) includes the following steps: 
- Material creation
- Potential file
- Simulation Setting
- Energy minimization
- Deformation

The images of were created using OVITO at 0 and 160 timeframe (start and end of the simulation)
